TypeScript is a Programming language made by Microsoft. It's like JavaScript but with some extra features that help developers write better and safer code!

In this blog, we will learn about some benefits and extra features of TypeScript!

TypeScript makes the code easier to understand, and it's so clean and organized. Typescript find mistake early before the code run. by this it will save our time and we can discover bug easily. in a big project if we are facing some error or problem, it's so difficult to find an error in other language but in typescript it's so easy to find and solved the error.it will mark the error for us. Typescript is code editor-friendly like VS Code. In JavaScript, we can use TypeScript, we don't have to rewrite the code. And we can convert TypeScript to any version of JavaScript, like ES5, ES3! In a word, TypeScript is so easy to read, safer to run better to grow in big projects.

Now, in the part we are about to discuss, some usage of TypeScript!


In TypeScript, we can declare an object shape in two ways. One is Type and the number two is Interface,
Both work the same in basic use cases. But there are some different use cases also.
The Interface can extend other interfaces or multiple interfaces, but in type, we have to use "&" to extend. Declaration merging is possible in Interface, but not possible in type. Unions and intersections are limited in Interface, but in Type, they're fully compatible. Both of them use React props.

There is also another property name 'keyof'
The keyof keyword in TypeScript is used to get a union of all property names (keys) of a given type.

example,
type person={
 name: string;
 age: number;
 email: string;
}
type personKeys=keyof person;
The output will be  'name'|'age'|'student'

Final Thoughts
TypeScript helps developers catch errors early, write scalable code, and work more efficiently in modern development environments. Whether you're just starting or working on a large enterprise app, TypeScript brings a layer of safety and clarity that plain JavaScript can’t offer.
